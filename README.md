# slack-desktop-SlackBuild
SlackBuild script for installing Slack messaging client under Slackware

With Slackware 14.2 being released soon-ish, SlackBuilds has frozen new submissions, so this won't be uploaded at SlackBuilds.org until then. In the meantime, you can install Slack under Slackware with the following commands:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mtslzr/slack-desktop-SlackBuild
$ cd slack-desktop-SlackBuild
$ sudo sh slack-desktop.SlackBuild
$ su -
# installpkg /tmp/slack-desktop*tgz
```

From Wikipedia: "Slack is a cloud-based team collaboration tool co-founded by Stewart Butterfield, Eric Costello, Cal Henderson, and Serguei Mourachov. Slack began as an internal tool used by their company, Tiny Speck, in the development of Glitch, a now defunct online game."
